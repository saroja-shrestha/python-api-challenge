# Analysis of WeatherPy:
Temperature vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot:
Northern Hemisphere: An r-value of -0.8338541576984546 indicates a strong negative correlation between the 'Latitude' and 'Max Temp' variables in the Northern Hemisphere dataset. This means that as the latitude increases (moving further north), the maximum temperature tends to decrease. The closer the r-value is to -1, the stronger the negative correlation.
Southern Hemisphere: An r-value of 0.7339566849009767 indicates a positive correlation between the 'Latitude' and 'Max Temp' variables in the Southern Hemisphere dataset. This means that as the latitude increases (moving further south), the maximum temperature tends to increase as well. The closer the r-value is to 1, the stronger the positive correlation.


Humidity vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot:
Northern Hemisphere: An r-value of -0.0009105076307917077 indicates a very weak or almost no linear relationship between these variables. The r-value being close to zero suggests that there is no significant linear relationship between latitude and humidity in the Northern Hemisphere based on the given data. It implies that changes in latitude have minimal impact on humidity levels in the Northern Hemisphere.
Southern Hemisphere: An r-value of 0.23323318869425205 indicates a weak positive correlation between the 'Latitude' and 'Humidity' variables in the Southern Hemisphere dataset. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for humidity to increase as latitude increases, but the correlation is not very strong.


Cloudiness vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot:
Northern Hemisphere: The r-value 0.07672004569746947 being close to zero suggests that the linear relationship between latitude and cloudiness in the Northern Hemisphere is very weak. It implies that latitude has a minimal impact on cloudiness levels in the Northern Hemisphere based on the given data.
Southern Hemisphere: The r-value 0.3295403758256422 being positive suggests that there is a weak positive linear relationship between latitude and cloudiness in the Southern Hemisphere based on the given data. It implies that there might be a slight tendency for cloudiness to increase as latitude increases in the Southern Hemisphere, although the relationship is not very strong.


Wind Speed vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot:
Northern Hemisphere: An r-value of 0.16742232643667618 indicates a weak positive correlation between the 'Latitude' and 'Wind Speed' variables in the Northern Hemisphere dataset. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for wind speed to increase as latitude increases, but the correlation is not very strong.
Southern Hemisphere: An r-value of -0.13678236095817486 indicates a weak negative correlation between the 'Latitude' and 'Wind Speed' variables in the Southern Hemisphere dataset. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for wind speed to decrease as latitude increases in the Southern Hemisphere, but the correlation is not very strong.
